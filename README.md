# Terraria and TShock Docker images

Based on Docker images from [ryansheehan/terraria](https://github.com/ryansheehan/terraria) with a command/server wrapper based on [joshbarrass/TerrariaServerWrapper](https://github.com/joshbarrass/TerrariaServerWrapper) which provides a clean exit when stopping the container.

Both AMD64 and ARM64 images are built.

Container images are hosted on GitHub Container Registry.
